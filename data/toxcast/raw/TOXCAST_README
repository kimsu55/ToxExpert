ToxCast is an extended data collection from the same initiative as Tox21, providing toxicology data for a large library of compounds based on in vitro high-throughput screening. The processed collection includes qualitative results of over 600 experiments on 8k compounds.


The data file contains a csv table, in which columns below are used:
     "smiles" - SMILES representation of the molecular structure
     "ACEA_T47D_80hr_Negative" ~ "Tanguay_ZF_120hpf_YSE_up" - Bioassays results
	please refer to the section "high-throughput assay information" at https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecaster-toxcasttm-data for details.
